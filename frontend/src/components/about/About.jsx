              <h3>Passion for Innovation Through Code and Creativity</h3>
              <p>
                As a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student, I am
                driven by a deep curiosity to understand how technology shapes
                our world. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong
                foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and
                software development, while also encouraging me to think
                critically and solve complex problems. Beyond the classroom, I
                actively engage in personal projects, internships, and coding
                challenges to sharpen my skills and stay updated with the
                latest in tech. Iâ€™m passionate about building impactful digital
                solutions, whether it's through web development, software
                engineering, or exploring the potential of AI and machine
                learning. With a balance of technical proficiency and a growth
                mindset, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry
                and drive innovation that makes a difference.
